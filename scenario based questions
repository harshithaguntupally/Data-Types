 <script>
        let age = parseInt(prompt("Enter your age:"))
        
        if(age>=18 ){
            let citizen = confirm("Are you a citizen?")
        let passedCitizenTest = confirm("Have you passed citizen test?")
            document.write("You are eligible to vote")
            
            if(age>=18 && !citizen && passedCitizenTest){
                document.write("You are eligible to vote")
            }
            
        }else{
            document.write("You are not eligible to vote")
        }
    </script>
OUTPUT :

Method 2 :

  <script>
        function isEligibleToVote(age, isCitizen, passedCitizenshipTest) {
        if (age < 18) {
            return "Not eligible to vote (Under 18)";
        }
        if (isCitizen || passedCitizenshipTest) {
            return "Eligible to vote";
        }
        return "Not eligible to vote";
    }
    console.log(isEligibleToVote(20, true, false)); 
    console.log(isEligibleToVote(17, false, true)); 
    console.log(isEligibleToVote(25, false, true)); 
    console.log(isEligibleToVote(30, false, false));
    </script>

Method 3:
function checkVotingEligibility(age, isCitizen, passedCitizenshipTest) {
            if (age < 18) {
              return "You cannot vote because you are under 18.";
            }
          
            if (isCitizen) {
              return "You are eligible to vote!";
            }
          
            if (passedCitizenshipTest) {
              return "You are eligible to vote!";
            }
          
            return "You are not eligible to vote because you are not a citizen and have not passed the citizenship test.";
          }
          
          function main() {
            const age = parseInt(prompt("Please enter your age:"));
            const isCitizen = prompt("Are you a citizen? (yes/no):").toLowerCase() === "yes";
            let passedCitizenshipTest = false;
          
            if (!isCitizen) {
              passedCitizenshipTest = prompt("Have you passed the citizenship test? (yes/no):").toLowerCase() === "yes";
            }
          
            const result = checkVotingEligibility(age, isCitizen, passedCitizenshipTest);
          
            console.log(result);
            alert(result); 
          }
          
          main();

Method 3:

      let resultMessage = '';
      if (age < 18) {

        resultMessage = "You are not eligible to vote.";
      }
      document.getElementById('result').textContent = resultMessage;
    }

                discount = 20;
            } else if (totalSpent > 50 && totalSpent <= 100) {

        const discount = calculateDiscount(totalSpent, isPremiumMember);
        const finalAmount = totalSpent - (totalSpent * (discount / 100));
